# Getting the Rules for Transactions

```{r}
#must include minimum support, minimum confidence, and target as arguments for apriori
#rules1 is for 0.1 confidence, rules2 for 0.5 confidence
rules1<- apriori(Courses.trans, parameter = list(supp=0.01, conf = 0.1, target = "rules"))

rules2<- apriori(Courses.trans, parameter = list(supp=0.01, conf = 0.5, target = "rules"))

#inspecting the first 6 rules for each of the rule sets
inspect(head(sort(rules1, by = "lift"), n=10))
inspect(head(sort(rules2, by = "lift"), n=10))

#seeing how the length between the rulesets differs
length(rules1)
length(rules2)
